Currently implemented:
* Displaying app metadata
* Installing applications
* Showing installation progress
* Showing that an app is already installed
* Removing apps

Currently not implemented:
* Showing uninstall progress
* Cancelling ongoing operations
* Packaging as Flatpak (might be unfixable)

This is a work in progress, and individual commits might be broken. The app might be unstable.

I would welcome help and advice about developing gnome applications (particularly in C), using AppStream and libflatpak, and packaging as a Flatpak. I also need an icon.
